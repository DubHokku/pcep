project:        Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)

description:    Example of PCEP protocol (RFC5440).

                This package implements the Path Computation Element (PCE)
                Communication Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path
                Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between two PCEs. Such
                interactions include path computation requests and path
                computation replies as well as notifications of specific states
                related to the use of a PCE in the context of Multiprotocol
                Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic
                Engineering. PCEP is designed to be flexible and extensible so
                as to easily allow for the addition of further messages and
                objects, should further requirements be expressed in the future.
